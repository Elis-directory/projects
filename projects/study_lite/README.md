Description:
A web application where users can create, share, and collaborate on learning resources such as notes, quizzes, and flashcards. This platform can include features like real-time collaboration, user authentication, and a recommendation system based on user preferences and performance.

Features:
User Authentication:

Sign up, login, and profile management.
OAuth integration (e.g., Google, Facebook).
Content Creation and Sharing:

Create and edit notes, quizzes, and flashcards.
Share resources with other users or make them public.
Real-time Collaboration:

Collaborative editing of notes and quizzes.
Real-time chat and discussion for each resource.
Recommendation System:

Recommend resources based on user preferences and past performance.
Machine learning to suggest personalized content.
Gamification:

Points and badges for creating content, participating in quizzes, and collaborating.
Responsive Design:

Mobile-friendly interface for accessing the platform on the go.
Technologies:
Frontend: React, Redux, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, WebSockets (for real-time collaboration)
Backend: Node.js, Express, MongoDB (or another NoSQL database), Socket.io (for real-time features)
Authentication: JWT, OAuth
Machine Learning: Python (for developing recommendation algorithms), TensorFlow.js (for running models in the browser)
Deployment: AWS, Heroku, or similar
